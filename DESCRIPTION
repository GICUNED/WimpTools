Description: Implements a graph-theoretical approach to model psychological change based on the Personal Construct Psychology (Kelly,1955). The method is derived from the Implication Grid proposed by Hinkle (1965) and extends traditional repertory grids by analyzing the hierarchical and structural relationships between personal constructs. This approach provides a quantitative framework to examine cognitive organization and change.
